# Backend assignment 

**I apologize for the delay. I started working on this assignment today morning at 7am Bali time zone and just finished it at 10am.**

In theory, everything should work fine except for the JWT token verification. I didn't have enough time to test all the endpoints.

Regarding the register endpoint, it asks for a profile picture. I have mentioned how this can be done in the test file.

## Overall, I believe this is how I would make the API. I am an expert when it comes to FastAPI and can implement best practices if you want me to finish it in perfect way i have no problem.
